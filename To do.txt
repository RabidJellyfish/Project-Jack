Game Modes
	- Implement GameScreen interface to make something like the "SingleMap" class, but
		for each game mode
		* Team Deathmatch
			- Copy paste free for all
			- Make teams by changing collision categories
			- Make some way of identifying teams (use alternate skin)
			- Change win screen to show team rather than individual player
		* One Vs All
			- Same as TDM, but only one player has a different collision cat
			- Tweak end game so that lone player wins if timer runs outs
		* Co op
			- 4 players on one team, bots spawn infinitely 4 at a time from the sky
			- Timer counts up instead of down and keep track of high score?
		* Other possibilities
			- Capture the flag: copy TDM, add flags, change win condition
			- King of the hill: copy free for all
			- Soccer
