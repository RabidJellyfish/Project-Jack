Game Modes
	* One Vs All
		- Same as TDM, but only one player has a different collision cat
		- Tweak end game so that lone player wins if timer runs outs
	* Co op
		- 4 players on one team, bots spawn infinitely 4 at a time from the sky
		- Timer counts up instead of down and keep track of high score?
	* Other possibilities
		- Capture the flag: copy TDM, add flags, change win condition
		- King of the hill: copy free for all
		- Soccer

AI
