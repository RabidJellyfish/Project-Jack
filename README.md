Project-Jack
============

Project Jack is a physics based, 2D fighting game. Rather than the players being composed of a single object and animated
sprite, each limb is treated as a separate physics object with it's own health. When limbs are damaged, they become weaker
and more difficult to use, and may eventually fall off!
